# Data Visualization course from Udacity: Data Visualization Nanodegree

In this course, I learnt the fundamentals of data visualization and design. 
    i)	Selecting the most appropriate data visualization based on the goal of the analysis. 
    ii)	Important design elements for graphically representing data. 
    iii)	Learnt to use Tableau and Flourish to build interactive and engaging dashboards

As part of this course, I completed the following projects:

1.
#### Build data Dashboards:
Sharing insights is an integral part of working with data. In this project, you’ll build interactive dashboards with Tableau. You’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. These types of visualizations help guide decision making to reach the best outcomes.

2.
#### Design a dashboard Part 1:
In this project, you’ll build a prototype of a dashboard for a specific audience with sketches and wireframes. The purpose of this project is to go through the prototyping and wireframing stage of dashboard design. This will include exploring and understanding the data and developing prototypes. You will create a proof-of-concept dashboard to explore the data in multiple ways.

3.
#### Design a dashboard Part 2:
In this project, you’ll transform the prototype into a final design of the dashboard for the specific audience. The design will be defined by the audience’s graphicacy, data literacy, domain expertise, user type, business metrics that matter most, and any other attributes that might influence the design. This dashboard’s main purpose is to ensure the appropriate data has been chosen for decisions needing to be made. Then you’ll make the dashboard truly insightful by adding design elements that draw the user’s eye to points of interest based on data. You’ll transform your visualizations to emphasize the most important points and add interactivity further facilitating the users’ desired actions.

4.

#### Build a data story Part 1:
In this mid-term project, you’ll take the role of a data science consultant for a large production company and use the Movies Metadata dataset. The goal will be to apply the skills in structuring a data story and to practice defining your own problem statement and the analyses you plan to do. The goal of this project is to define your own problem statement and the flow of a powerful data story. You’ll create a ghost deck with the problem statement, potential analyses, and a set of potential recommendations.

5.
#### Build a data Story Part 2:
In this project, you’ll continue to build on the mid-term project. Building on the ghost deck, you will perform various analyses to understand and find insights from the Movies Metadata. You will identify the limitations and biases in data that affect the recommendations. You will put it all together by building on your ghost deck, conducting the actual analysis, and creating a final presentation with final recommendations and an executive summary of key next steps.

6.
#### Animate a data story Part 1:
In this project, you will use a World Bank Indicators data file to create an interactive data presentation using indicators of your choice. You will choose the fields for various dimensions (e.g., country, year) and identify trends and patterns in the data set. You will apply your skills of creating charts, graphs, maps, dashboards and story types in Tableau and create a coherent data story for your audience.

7.
#### Animate a data story Part 2:

In this project, you will build on your mid-term project from the World Bank Indicators data file to create an animated data story. In this final part of the project, you will create an animated data story and add an audio track to create a narrated finished product that you can add to your portfolio.

8.
#### Reviewing and revamping a MakeoverMonday dashboard:
In the capstone project, you will write a blog to describe how you would improve an existing visualization. You will have a choice of datasets to choose from, and you will write about your recommendations that would improve existing visuals were you to create a different dashboard, data presentation, or animated story.
